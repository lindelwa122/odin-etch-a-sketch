## Features
The app includes the following features:

### Drawing
You can simply draw/sketch by colouring the grid by hovering over it.

### New Grid
You can set your own rows and columns. The only limitation is that they both have to be bigger than 0 and equal or smaller than 100. 

### Change Colour
Change the colour as you please. Just ensure it's a valid colour name otherwise no colour will be applied to the grid.

Changing colour doesn't reset the grid or update the already coloured boxes.

### Randomize Colour
This will generate a random colour when you hover over a box. There are 16 777 216 possibilities that can come up.

### Clear Grid
This will clear every colour on the grid.
